An assorted collection of publicly released files from Ioncube, focusing on their encoder evaluators, documentation, and loaders.
Any help sorting and confirming versions is apperciated, as is the inclusion of any missing files people have.

Versions
========
Version numbers: These version numbers aren't official, as Ioncube has in the past done releases without incrementing version numbers.
If an internal version number is found that is more specific, we could use that.
Also, loader version and encoder version do not have to match.
