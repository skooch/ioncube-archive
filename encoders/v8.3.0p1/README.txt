                          (Loaders before 4.4). These are from the previous
                          Encoder release (7.0), and therefore do not have
                          features that are new in the version 8 series of
                          Encoders. The licensed software also includes
                          obsolete Encoders from two major releases ago.



Using Encoded Files - the ionCube Loader
========================================

A free component called the ionCube Loader is provided to process encoded
files. Loaders are available for many platforms, and with ionCube technology a
widely used industry standard, many hosting servers have the Loader component
installed by default. Where it is not pre-installed then depending on the 
web server configuration, a user can either easily install it themselves, or
otherwise server administrators / hosting providers would usually do this
if required.

Two tools are provided to assist with Loader installation from 
http://loaders.ioncube.com. A Windows program called the Loader Installer is 
recommended, which can deploy a Loader to a remote server using FTP or sFTP
and make the necessary changes to a php.ini file. An alternative is a PHP script
called the Loader Wizard. The Wizard will indicate which Loader package and file
are required to be installed, and advise on the PHP configuration changes.

Loaders can be downloaded from http://loaders.ioncube.com

To get a Loader setup for yourself, use the Loader Installer or simply install
the Loader Wizard script (loader-wizard.php) onto a target web server, 
point your browser to the script and follow the instructions. 


What Next?
==========

The User Guide PDF will guide you gently into the product with some simple
examples, and then covers all the available Encoder options in detail.
Other topics such as license file creation and an API in the Loader are
also covered in later chapters. For a quick reminder when using the Encoder,
running it with the --help option will give a summary of all available options.
