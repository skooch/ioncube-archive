
	     ionCube PHP Encoder 6.5 Release Notes
	     -------------------------------------

*** Please see below for changes relating to the latest 6.5 revision.

Version 6.5 of the ionCube PHP Encoder introduces powerful new security
and usability features. Please note that due to these changes Loaders with
version 3.1 or greater are required.

* Encryption of arbitrary files

The Encoder now has the ability to encrypt any file. This feature may be used,
for example, to encrypt configuration XML files, or HTML templates for use by
Smarty. To specify files to be encrypted the option --encrypt is used in the 
same way as --encode is used for encoding PHP files.

To read encrypted files the Loader API has been extended with the function

	mixed ioncube_read_file(string path 
			[,bool &was_encrypted [,string passphrase] ] ] )

This function can read both encrypted and unencrypted files, the second 
argument being used to return whether the file was encrypted or not. 
Encrypted files can only be read by PHP files encoded with the same Encoder 
installation. In other words encrypted files are protected from viewing by
other ionCube PHP Encoder customers.

Encrypted files can also be written by the Loader by using the function

	long ioncube_write_file(string path, string content 
			[,bool encrypt [,string passphrase] ] )


* New obfuscation feature

Compiled PHP bytecode contains certain information such as function names 
which are used by PHP's execution engine. To prevent these strings from 
appearing in encoded files version 6.5 has a new obfuscation layer. The 
new option --obfuscate can take arguments 'functions', 'locals', 'linenos' to
obfuscate the names of functions, local variables, and line numbers
respectively in the compiled bytecode. Options '--obfuscate all' and 
'--obfuscate none' can also be used.

While it is desirable to obfuscate an application, it is sometimes necessary
to prevent certain function names from being obfuscated. For example functions 
external to the application called by the application should not be
obfuscated. 

Similarly application functions called by external scripts should not be 
obfuscated. To specify these exceptions a text file should be created with 
the name of each function occurring one per line, and the option 
'--obfuscation-exclusion-file' should be used to pass the name of the file to 
the Encoder. It is not necessary to add the names of built-in PHP functions 
to this file.


* Post-encoding step (Windows GUI)

It is now possible to execute a command after the Encoder has finished encoding
a project. This option supports environment variable subtitutions, so 
the following command will open the target folder after encoding is complete:

	C:\WINDOWS\explorer "{TARGET_DIR}"


* Updated Loaders

In order to execute files created with the new Encoder it is necessary to 
install the latest version of the ionCube PHP Loader (at least version 3.1.5).
The latest version of the Loader is always available from:
	
		http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php


* Upgrade Notes (Linux/FreeBSD)

The following notes apply to those users upgrading an Encoder installation
from a previous version.

After unpacking the archive it may be necessary to generate a new license 
request. After the request has been processed new license data can be 
downloaded from your account area. 

It may be necessary for the user of the Encoder to have write permissions to
the directory containing the Encoder the first time the Encoder is run. 
The Encoder will then generate a lock file in that directory. After the first 
run of the Encoder the permissions on the folder can be restored to their 
previous state.


		
		ionCube PHP Encoder/Loader Changes
		----------------------------------

Version 6.5.12 - 20 February 2007
---------------------------------

* Enhancement to allow classes derived from builtin classes (e.g. Exception)
  to be declared after their own subclasses.

* New command line option added for declaring custom autoglobals; e.g.

    --register-autoglobal _MYAUTO

  will process use of $_MYAUTO inside a function as if it were a global.

* GUI: Custom autoglobals feature added to the Miscellaneous project settings
  tab.

* Displaying license properties with make_license (--decode-license) or
  via the Encoder GUI now displays string properties delimited by quotes and
  correctly displays integer properties.

* GUI: Toolbar button added to display license file creation settings and 
  minor cosmetic changes.


Version 6.5.11 - 3 January 2007
-------------------------------

This release has numerous changes, that include the purely cosmetic, a few
bug fixes, and both some minor and major functional enhancements for usability.

These include:

* GUI: Decoding of server data files via drag/drop now supports recognising
  and processing of gzip compressed files.

* GUI: Source files page and project tree enhanced. Convenience buttons added
  for changing file/directory rules in addition to the existing right click
  popup menu.
  Additional visual cues to indicate project file and directory states. 
  Popup menu options enhanced.

* GUI: Double clicking or selecting "Open" on an item in the source files
  tree now displays the usual Windows "Open with" dialog if no program
  association is known.

* GUI: "Open with..." dialog added to project tree popup menu.

* GUI: The expand / collapse state of the source files tree in the Project
  Settings is now maintained between closing and reopening the Settings
  dialog.
  
* GUI: The Project Wizard has been updated.

* GUI: Double clicking on errors in the popup errors window now opens the
  associated source file or displays an "Open with..." dialog.

  target.

* GUI: The default encoding extensions on new projects are now .php, .php4,
  .php5 and .inc

* GUI: The default ignore pattern of .* is removed for new projects.

* GUI: Although dot files were processed correctly in previous versions, they
  may not always have shown in the source files tree. This anomoly is
  corrected.

* PHP 5 Encoder: Support is now added for a couple of PHP 5.1+ specific
  features that were not available in the PHP 5.0 language specification.
  In keeping with our commitment to support PHP 5.0 and not just 5.1+,
  encoded files using 5.1+ specific features can also run on a PHP 5.0 system.
 
* PHP 5 Encoder: Support added for $this[] when used by ArrayObject instances.
 
* PHP 4 & 5 Encoder: Non-PHP source files that are already encrypted are now
  copied instead of being encrypted again.

* PHP 4 & 5 Encoder: Enhancements to handle cases where the encoding target
  exists and is not removed prior to encoding (e.g. if --merge is used), and
  where some existing target files or directories are read only.

* PHP 4 & 5 Encoder: Discrepancies between how parse errors are reported with
  the PHP 4 and PHP 5 Encoder are fixed.
  
* PHP 4 & 5 Encoder: Syntax checking now skips files that were ignored with
  --ignore.

* PHP 4 & 5 Encoder: Source files explicitly specified on the command line
  will now be ignored if they match a --ignore pattern, and not only if the
  source item was a directory.
