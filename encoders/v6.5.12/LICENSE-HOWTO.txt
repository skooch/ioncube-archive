                    The ionCube Encoder - Version 6.5
                    ---------------------------------

LICENSING YOUR ENCODER
----------------------

Your Encoder comes with an allocation of 1 or more unassigned licenses.
Each license can be assigned to any machine having an Ethernet network adaptor.

The licensing process has two simple steps, described below.

  * Generating a license key request and sending it to us.
  * Installing a license file from us.


GENERATING A LICENSE KEY REQUEST
--------------------------------

To assign a license you must first generate a license request. The Encoder
can do this for you:

* On Unix, run the Encoder with the --license-request option on the machine
  where you wish to use the Encoder. The Encoder will create a license
  request file for each network interface installed into your computer. 
  It will also display the name of each interface found and the name of the
  file it created containing the license request. If the Encoder was unable
  to create license request files then the request data will be displayed
  instead. Your network interfaces do not need to be connected to any network
  but must be visible to the operating system.

  The license on Unix may be affected if the Encoder is moved, and it is
  recommended that you generate the license request from the location where 
  you expect to use the Encoder. Installing to a temporary directory, creating
  a license request and then moving the Encoder installation may invalidate the
  license when you receive it. 

* On Windows there is an item in the ionCube program group for creating
  licenses. Click the Start menu, and in the ionCube entry, select
  the "License Request Generator" item.

If there is no output then there may be no active Ethernet interface for that
machine. You sould rememdy this and try again. Please note that no information
is sent from your machine to us at any point, and the network interface does
need to be physically connected to any network, just visible to the operating
system.


SUBMITTING YOUR LICENSE REQUEST
-------------------------------

Email the license request file to us at licenses@ioncube.com for the machine
that you wish to use. If a machine has more than one interface, send a
request for the interface that is least likely to change, and most likely
to be active or possible to make active. If you have a choice between a 
wireless card and a wired adaptor, the wired adaptor is likely to be the 
better choice to license.

Your license request may be processed automatically, and in this case you will
be sent an email response within a few seconds. If the request could not
be processed automatically, it will be handled as soon as possible by 
the licensing department, and you will receive a response once this has been
done.  

* Using DHCP?

Using DHCP is not a problem as the IP address is not used for licensing
purposes. It is shown in the license request data, but this is only to help
you identify which adaptor is which.


INSTALLING YOUR LICENSE
-----------------------

When we receive your license request we will email you back with instructions
for installing a license file. Once this has been completed, your Encoder
will then be licensed and fully operational. If you have any problems then
please submit a support ticket at

WHAT IF I WANT TO TRANSFER MY LICENSE?
--------------------------------------

We have provided a simple mechanism for transferring your Encoder license to
a new machine. It is necessary first to revoke your license on the old 
machine. On Unix, run the Encoder with the option --revoke-license. 
On Windows there is a menu option on the Windows Start/ionCube program 
menu group. This will produce a revoke file with filename starting
'revoke_file' in the same directory as the Encoder. 

Send the revoke file to licenses@ioncube.com and we will free your license.
You can then install the Encoder on the new machine, and submit a new license
request from the new macbine as described above.

It is important to revoke your old license before removing your old Encoder
installation as the revoke file confirms for us that the Encoder has been
uninstalled. 

The revoke feature should be used when it is necessary to permanently 
transfer a license to a new machine. This feature is not intended to be
used frequently as a way to effectively license two machines - the Encoder
is licensed on a per-machine basis and so a second license would be needed
to use more than one machine on a regular basis.
