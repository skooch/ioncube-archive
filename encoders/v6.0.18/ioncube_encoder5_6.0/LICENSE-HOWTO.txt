                    The ionCube Encoder - Version 6
                    -------------------------------

LICENSING YOUR ENCODER
----------------------

Your encoder comes with an allocation of 1 or more unassigned licenses.
Each license can be assigned to any machine having an Ethernet network adaptor.

The licensing process has two simple steps, described below.

  * Generating a license key request and sending it to us.
  * Downloading and installing a license file from us.


GENERATING A LICENSE KEY REQUEST
--------------------------------

To assign a license you must first generate a license request. The encoder
can do this for you:

* Run the encoder with the --license-request option on a machine where you
  wish to use the encoder. The Encoder will attempt to create a license
  request file for each network interface installed into your computer. 
  It will also display the name of each interface found and the name of the
  file it created containing the license request. If the Encoder was unable
  to create license request files then the request data will be displayed
  instead. Your network interfaces do not need to be connected to any network
  but must be configured with an IP address.

If there is no output then there may be no Ethernet interface for that
machine. Please contact us at support@ioncube.com in that case.

On Windows there is an item in the ionCube program group for creating
licenses. Click the Start menu, and in the ionCube entry, select
the "License Request Generator" item.


SUBMITTING YOUR LICENSE REQUEST
-------------------------------

Email the license request to us at licenses@ioncube.com for the machine(s)
that you wish to use. If a machine has more than one interface, send a
request for the interface least likely to change on the machine. Licensing
to a removable network is also recommended if at all possible.

Your license request may be processed automatically, and in this case you will
be sent an email response within a few seconds. If the request could not
be processed automatically, it will be handled as soon as possible by 
the licensing department, and you will receive a response once this has been
done.  


INSTALLING YOUR LICENSE
-----------------------

When we receive your license request we will email you back with instructions
for installing a license file. Once this has been completed, your encoder
will then be licensed and fully operational. If you have any problems then
please contact us at support@ioncube.com


WHAT IF MY NETWORK CARD BREAKS OR IF I CHANGE MY MACHINE?
---------------------------------------------------------

We are flexible about relicensing customers when there is a genuine need to
do so, however network cards are actually very reliable. They provide a
cheap and convenient 'dongle' to license against, and failure is unlikely.
We do recommend licensing to a removable network card if you can so that 
it may be moved into a new machine in the future. This will also assist in
handling any relicense requests in the future.
