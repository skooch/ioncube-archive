NOTES FOR YOUR EVALUATION VERSION
---------------------------------

* GET THE MOST FROM YOUR EVALUATION WITH OUR IONCUBE DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT 

The ionCube PHP Encoder is a sophisticated and highly versatile encoding 
engine. To help you to get the most from your evaluation version, our
technical support team will be happy to answer any questions that you 
may have relating to Encoder deployment.


* EVALUATION VERSION

The evaluation version of the Encoder has all the features of our flagship 
product, the Cerberus Encoder. Features contained in the Cerberus version 
not contained in the Basic Encoder include the ability to restrict files 
to only run on certain machines, the ability to set 'expiry dates' for files, 
and more.

* ENCODED FILES

All features of the evaluation Encoder are functional. However:

1) Encoded files will expire after 36 hours, (or sooner if you encode files to
   expire earlier), but files can be reencoded again.

2) Encoded files contain a PHP comment to show they are encoded by the 
   evaluation Encoder. This text does not alter operation of encoded files, 
   and is not present in the release version. 

* EVALUATION PERIOD

The evaluation version will be functional for approximately 14 days.
