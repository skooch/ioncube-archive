IONCUBE PERFORMANCE SYSTEM (EVALUATION AND NON-EVALUATION) 

THE FRIENDLY VERSION:

The full license agreement as set out below relating to the evaluation and
non-evaluation versions of the Performance System will at all times be the 
legal agreement that relates to your use of the Performance System.

In summary, the Performance System can be used by you and any persons within 
the same company, organisation etc. on any licensed machine. The purchased
software comes with one license as standard, and additional licenses may
be purchased as required. Machines are licensed based on machine identity,
part of which is the MAC address of a machines Ethernet interface. The 
software is licensed based on CPU and machines with multiple CPUs will
require additional licenses. A dual-core CPU is considered as a single CPU.

You can make limited backups and keep those offsite if necessary. 

Product support is given via email or telephone. 

The product is likely to change over time, and non-major upgrades may be
distributed for free. These will generally be features that we wanted to
include in the very beginning but that time constraints just didn't
allow. Should the product take on a new direction, then upgrade fees may
apply. Suggestions are also welcome, and may become incorporated into the
product.
