IONCUBE PACKAGE FOUNDRY (EVALUATION AND NON-EVALUATION) 

THE FRIENDLY VERSION:

The full license agreement as set out below relating to the evaluation and
non-evaluation versions of the Package Foundry will at all times be the legal
agreement that relates to your use of the Package Foundry.

In summary, the ionCube Package Foundry can be used by you and any persons 
within the same company, organisation etc. on any licensed machine.
The purchased software comes with one license as standard, and additional
licenses may be purchased as required. The software is licensed per machine,
based on the machine identity. You can make limited backups and keep those
offsite if necessary. Packages created with the Tool are free of ionCube
license restrictions.

Product support is given via email or telephone. 

The product is likely to change over time, and non-major upgrades may be
distributed for free. These will generally be features that we wanted to
include in the very beginning but that time constraints just didn't
allow. Should the product take on a new direction, then upgrade fees may
apply. Suggestions are also welcome, and may become incorporated into the
product.
