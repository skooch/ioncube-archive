	<h4>2.1. Compression and Package Transfer</h4>
<p>
Applications packaged with the ionCube Package Foundry are stored internally as compressed 'tar.gz'
files.
</p>

<p>
When the application is uploaded to the target server, the installer may attempt to upload the package as a compressed archive, then extract the archive remotely using a PHP script uploaded to the server. If the target server does not support this operation, however, then the package is extracted before upload.
</p>

<p>
This procedure ensures that installation time is kept to a minimum.
