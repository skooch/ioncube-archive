Advanced IPF settings are entered on the <b>Advanced</b> tab:</p>

<p>
A <b>post-install script</b> can be triggered at the end of installation. This script could, for example, be a PHP script which would 
modify some files in the package. Some tasks may not require user-insteraction, but some may require a response. In the latter case the 
script will be launched in a browser, otherwise it will be accessed silently. The script can be any file in the package, and need not even be a script: it could be a plain .html file, or even an image! If a post-install script is used, the end-user will be prompted to enter the URL of the package on their web server.
</p>

<p>If a non-interactive post-install script outputs any text, then this text will be shown to the end-user in a dialog. This allows the display of any configuration errors that may occur.</p>

<p>
If the <b>Run post-install script after configuration step</b> box is checked then the post-install script will not be run at the end of installation. Instead the script will be executed each time the end-user clicks the <b>Apply</b> button on the Configurator, after the configurable files have been uploaded to the server.
</p>

<p>
When using the <b>Configuration Tool</b>, it is desirable to be able to verify changes made to the configuration. The main page
of the product specified on this tab is the page which is launched in the user's default browser when they click the <b>Launch</b> button. If a main page is used, the end-user will be prompted to enter the URL of the package on their web server.
</p>

<p>
Those files added to the list on this tab can be configured by end-users using the IPF <b>Configuration Tool</b>. 
Items on the list should be text files as they will be edited using the simple built-in text editor.
